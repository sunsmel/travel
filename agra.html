						<h2>Agra: The city of wonders</h2>
						<p>The world's heritage land, city of wonder and stunning architectural. The remains of glorious
							Mughal
							Empire spread across cities.</p>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/tajagra.jpg" alt="Taj Mahal close up" /></a>
					<p>Agra, India is a city steeped in history and cultural significance, but perhaps its most famous
						landmark is the Taj Mahal, a stunning monument to love. Commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal
						Emperor Shah Jahan as a tribute to his late wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal stands as a
						testament to the enduring power of love and devotion. We explored the rich history and stunning
						architecture of the Taj Mahal and delve into what makes this iconic monument a symbol of love
						that has captivated visitors for centuries. </p>
					<p>Stepping into Agra, India is like stepping back in time to an era of grandeur and opulence. The
						magnificent fortresses and palaces that dot the city, every corner holds a new adventure. But
						the true gem of Agra is the Taj Mahal, a breath-taking monument to love that has stood the test
						of time for nearly 400 years. As we approached the Taj, we were struck by its stunning beauty,
						surrounded by lush greenery, and reflecting serenely in the calm waters of the Yamuna River. The
						white marble facade shimmered in the soft light of the sun, its intricate carvings and
						calligraphy a testament to the skill of the artisans who built it. Walking inside the Taj, we were
						transported to another world, with intricate mosaic tile work and stunning marble inlay
						decorating every surface. The main tomb, housed beneath the central dome, is a symphony of
						symmetry, with delicate floral motifs and verses from the Quran woven into the walls. But what
						truly takes your breath away is the feeling of love that permeates the entire space, from the
						stories of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal to the thousands of couples who come here to exchange
						their vows of love. Visiting the Taj Mahal was an experience we will never forget. From the
						moment we set foot inside its walls, we were struck by its timeless beauty and the depth of the
						love story it tells. It is a testament to the enduring power of love, and a symbol of hope and
						inspiration for generations to come.</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/agrafort.jpg" alt="Agra fort from entrance" /></a>
					<p>Agra Fort is a stunning piece of architecture that tells the story of India's rich and complex
						history. As we approached the fort, we were struck by its sheer size and imposing presence,
						rising from the banks of the Yamuna River. The red sandstone walls are adorned with intricate
						carvings and inlaid with marble, reflecting the opulence and grandeur of the Mughal Empire.
						Stepping inside the fort, we were transported to another world, surrounded by lush courtyards
						and grand palaces. Each building is more stunning than the last, showcasing the intricate
						carvings and intricate tile work that are hallmarks of Mughal architecture. I was particularly
						struck by the Sheesh Mahal, a palace of mirrors that shimmered and glimmered in the soft light
						filtering through the intricate latticework. But what truly sets Agra Fort apart is the sense of
						history that permeates every corner. As we walked through its halls, we felt as though we were
						walking in the footsteps of emperors and courtiers, experiencing a world that was both lavish
						and brutal. From the sprawling grounds of the Jahangir Palace to the private chambers of the
						royal women, every room held its own story, a testament to the complex and rich history of the
						Mughal Empire. Visiting Agra Fort was a humbling experience, a chance to step back in time and
						experience the grandeur and elegance of one of India's most magnificent architectural treasures.
						It is a must-see for anyone interested in India's rich history and cultural heritage, and a
						testament to the enduring beauty of Mughal architecture.</p>
					<p>The Baby Taj, also known as the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daula, is a must-visit destination for anyone
						visiting Agra. This stunning mausoleum is widely considered to be a prototype for the Taj Mahal
						and is often referred to as the "Jewel Box" of Mughal architecture. The Baby Taj is set in a
						beautiful garden on the banks of the Yamuna River and is renowned for its intricate carvings,
						marble inlaid work, and stunning architectural design. The mausoleum is a testament to the skill
						and creativity of the Mughal artisans and is a fascinating example of the fusion of Persian,
						Indian, and Islamic architectural styles. As you wander through the complex, you'll be amazed by the intricate carvings and intricate
						details that adorn the walls and ceilings. The use of inlaid marble, semi-precious stones, and
						intricate floral designs creates a breathtaking visual experience that is sure to leave you in
						awe.</p>
					<p>In addition to its stunning architecture, the Baby Taj also holds significant historical
						importance. It was built in memory of Mirza Ghiyas Beg, a wealthy Persian merchant who served as
						the Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire and was the first tomb in India to be entirely made of
						marble.</p>

					<p>Fatehpur Sikri- A short drive from Agra will take you to the city of Fatehpur Sikri. It makes
						visitors fascinated by the rich cultural and architectural heritage of the Mughal Empire. The
						city, built by the great Mughal emperor Akbar the Great in the 16th century, was once the
						capital of the Mughal Empire. Upon arriving, we were immediately struck by the well-preserved
						buildings and intricate carvings that adorned the walls and pillars of the complex. We were also
						amazed by the sheer size of the complex, which covers an area of over 35 square kilometers.</p>

					<p>One of the most notable buildings in Fatehpur Sikri is the Jama Masjid, a stunning mosque with a
						central courtyard surrounded by pillared halls and grand arches. The mosque is considered one of
						the finest examples of Mughal architecture and is a testament to the wealth and power of the
						Mughal Empire during its heyday. </p>
					<p>Another impressive structure in Fatehpur Sikri is the Buland Darwaza, a massive gate that serves
						as the entrance to the complex. The gate is considered one of the largest in the world and is
						adorned with intricate carvings and calligraphy. As we walked through the gate, we couldn't help
						but feel a sense of awe at the sheer scale of the structure.</p>
					<p>Aside from the impressive architecture, Fatehpur Sikri also has a rich cultural heritage. The
						city was home to several important institutions, including a palace for the emperor's wives and
						a school for the study of religion and philosophy. These institutions played a significant role
						in shaping the cultural and intellectual landscape of the Mughal Empire during its time. </p>
					<p>In conclusion, our visit to Agra and Fatehpur Sikri was truly a memorable experience. The city's
						well-preserved architecture and rich cultural heritage offer a glimpse into the grandeur of the
						Mughal Empire during its golden age. We highly recommend a visit to this historical gem to
						anyone interested in Indian history and architecture. Please write to us for planning itinerary
						and resources.</p>
