					<p>Umrah, also known as the minor pilgrimage, is a spiritual journey to the holy city of Mecca in
						Saudi Arabia. It is considered important in Islam as it is one of the five pillars of the faith.
						According to Islamic beliefs and scripture, Umrah has numerous benefits for the individual both
						physically and spiritually.</p>
					<p>Performing Umrah is believed to purify the soul, erase past sins, and increase one's level of
						spirituality and devotion to Allah. It is also believed to bring blessings what Allah pleases,
						as well as improving one's health and overall well-being. Furthermore, Umrah is also seen to
						increase one's knowledge and understanding of Islam, and to strengthen bonds between fellow
