						important to prepare your personal photos according to the required specifications before
						filling out the form. </p>
					<p>Once you have completed the booking process, you will receive an email with the issued visa and
						insurance for the duration of your stay in Saudi Arabia. It states that the electronic stopover
						visa
						is issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is valid for 96
						hours. However, it is important to note that obtaining the electronic stopover visa does not
						necessarily guarantee entry to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as the documents will be checked by
						the
						passport officer to verify the validity of the information that was submitted. </p>

						Holidays banner on the reservation confirmation page, or from manage my booking Saudia Holiday
						banner, or the Saudia Holidays website. When you arrive at the hotel, present your boarding pass
						to the hotel receptionist to benefit from the free accommodation offer. </p>
					<p>It is important to note that a stopover visa is not accepted if the guest has a valid visa or
						documents allowing him to enter the Kingdom. Companions under the age of eighteen are included
						in the visa applicant's application, as companions of this age group are not allowed to apply
						individually. If the application is rejected for one of the applicants, all persons attached to
						the same application will be rejected accordingly. The responsibility to ensure the validity of
						the travel documents, the validity of the visa, the duration of the layover, health
						requirements, attendance for the flight before the take-off time, and the amendment of the
						reservation after the issuance of the visa and tickets is the responsibility of the traveler. To
						make it more convenient for pilgrims there is free shuttle bus service between Jeddah airport
						and Makkah. Airport contact is +966 920011233 for details.
