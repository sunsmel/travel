					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/dhifushii.jpg" alt="Dhiffushi arrival point" /></a>
					<p>Our recent trip to Dhiffushi in the Maldives was an unforgettable experience. From the moment we
						arrived at the Male airport, we were swept away by the beauty of the crystal-clear waters and
						the lush greenery of the surrounding islands. The speed boat ride to Dhiffushi was a fantastic
						experience, with the breeze blowing through hair and the sun shining down on us. It felt like
						we were in paradise. </p>
					<p>Once we arrived at Dhiffushi, we were greeted by the hosts and the friendly locals. We stayed on
						different sides of the island, each with its own unique sea view. Every morning, we would wake
						up to the sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the sight of the sunrise over the
						horizon. We would spend days swimming in the turquoise waters, snorkeling with manta rays, baby
						sharks, turtles, different species of colorful fishes on beach and reef, and exploring the
						lonely sandbanks with the local birds. </p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/sandbankdhi.jpg" alt="sandbank next to dhifushii" /></a>
					<p>One of the highlights of our trip to Dhiffushi in the Maldives was exploring the beautiful
						sandbanks. These isolated stretches of sand in the middle of the ocean were truly a sight to
						behold. We loved walking along the sandy shores and taking in the breathtaking views of the
						surrounding waters. The sandbanks were also home to a variety of local birds, and it was a
						privilege to observe them in their natural habitat. </p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/fishingdhi.jpg" alt="first catch big game" /></a>
					<p>Another incredible experience we had was fishing in the big sea and reef. We were able to witness
						the sunrise and sunset over the ocean while we were out on the water, and it was truly a magical
						experience. The sunrise and sunset over the water were truly breathtaking, and we felt a deep
						sense of peace and serenity watching the colors change as the sun rose and set. The fishing was
						also great fun, and we caught a variety of fish. </p>
					<p>The beauty of the sunrise and sunset over the ocean was a daily occurrence during our stay in
						Dhiffushi. Whether we were relaxing on the beach, fishing, or exploring the island, we were
						never far from the stunning beauty of the sun as it rose and set over the water. The colors in
						the sky were simply breathtaking, and we found ourselves constantly stopping to take it all in.
					</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/quitebeach.jpg" alt="northern beach overlooking meru" /></a>
					<p>We also enjoyed trying the local cuisine at different restaurants on the island. The food was
						delicious. We did notice that some tourists were not following the local dress code, which was a
						bit disappointing, but it didn't detract from our overall experience. </p>
					<p>We were blessed and lucky that rain or bad weather didnâ€™t interrupt our adventures during our
						entire stay except during nights and in middle of an excursion and on last day when departing
						from another adventure at Mafushii, we were able to enjoy all that Dhiffushi had to offer. We
						were able to witness the stunning sunsets from all over the beach, and it was the perfect end to
						each day of our stay. </p>
					<p>Overall, our trip to Dhiffushi was a true paradise experience, and we would highly recommend it
						to anyone looking for a relaxing and beautiful vacation. All the activities are worth doing,
						these memories last a lifetime. The island is truly a gem in the Maldives, and we can't wait to
						go back. Write to us for more details and planning.</p>
